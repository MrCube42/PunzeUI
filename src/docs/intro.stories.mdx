# Our Mission

Our company is world-renowned and stands out not only for its universally recognised corporate identity, which is reflected in the design of its website, applications and machines, but also for the consistently excellent quality and usability of its entire product range.
For this reason, among others, one of the most important goals is for the project teams to be able to develop applications that are consistent and of high quality in both appearance and usability.
In order to achieve this, a team was set up to design, develop and continuously maintain a so-called design system based on these characteristics.
The result of this is **PunzeUI**.

## Installation of PunzeUI
